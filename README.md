# NodeJs Social Network App

## Description
this repository contains my training process while coding along with learning websockets course academind by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-schwarzmueller/). 

#### IMPORTANT:
please pay attention to branch history, after every major step of developement I create a branch from it and they are sorted as work progression.

## Usage
